### About me

I can't live without writing shitty code. This is part of my life. I mostly write in `Python`, or `C#`. Once I was interested in the `Java` language, but quickly realized that it was not mine

My last project is `python-bot`. This is a project that has survived a lot, only you won't see it :/
